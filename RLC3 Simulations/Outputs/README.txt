These files contain the community simulation outputs sorted into one file for each number of species (XmemberDF). These annotated tables were generated from the raw outputs of the MATLAB scripts by adding column headings and converting number species IDs to the 2-letter codes used throughout the paper.
Columns labeled with species code or "Butyrate" represent the mean of the simulations of all parameter sets from the posterior distribution sample.
Other statistics are labeled as such. Some explanations:
XPct represents the Xth percentile of the output distribution
Nsims is the number of simulations in the output distribution
Community is the species codes for those present separated by '-'
NumSpecies is the number of species in the community (useful when concatenating tables from multiple community richness levels)
